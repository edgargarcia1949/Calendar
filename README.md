Python code in this repository is source code for a Calendar project that includes
instructions and 3 Calendar programs. Yearly, Monthly and Weekly calendars
can be created and screenshots can be saved with the down arrow for later printout.
This program was created to help me make yearly calendars for my family to post
upcoming events, birthdays, anniversaries and other such things.
The programs wake up in the current year and month and calendars can
easily be changed from year to year, month to month, and week to week with arrow
keys and text boxes.
